# What is React?

**React** is a **JavaScript library** for building interactive **user interfaces**.

By user interfaces, we mean the elements that users see and interact with on-screen.

By library, we mean React provides helpful functions to build UI, but leaves it up to the developer where to use those functions in their application.

Part of Reactâ€™s success is that it is relatively unopinionated about the other aspects of building applications. This has resulted in a flourishing ecosystem of third-party tools and solutions.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function Hello(props) {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}
```

It also means, however, that building a complete React application from the ground up requires some effort. Developers need to spend time configuring tools and reinventing solutions for common application requirements.
